## 📚 Overview

- **Data Wrangling:** Cleaning, transforming and reshaping raw datasets  
- **Feature Scaling:** Normalization, standardization and robust scaling  
- **Visualization:** Exploring data distributions, correlations and patterns  

All notebooks use popular Python libraries like **pandas**, **NumPy**, **scikit-learn**, **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.

## ✨ Features

- Handling missing values and outliers  
- Encoding categorical variables  
- Applying multiple scaling methods (Min-Max, StandardScaler etc.)  
- Visualizing relationships with scatter plots, box plots, histograms and heatmaps  
- Step-by-step, beginner-friendly explanations
